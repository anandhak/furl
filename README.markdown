FURL
====

Idea stolen from Hurl, For our application to explore the API. It is pure jQuery and HTML5 based so it can be use for any application.
Obvioysly it has to be hosted in your app or something. otherwise the dreaded cross side ajax scripting issues prop up.

Being a simple html page makes it simpler to use it in your application because it can simply be git submoduled and checked inited into the public folder.

Currently it only supports simple Requests, More advanced features coming soon.
